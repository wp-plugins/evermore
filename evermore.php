INSTALLATION

1. Copy this file into the plugins directory in your WordPress installation (wp-content/plugins).

2. Log in to WordPress Admin. Go to the Plugins page and click Activate for this plugin.

USAGE

Evermore automatically abbreviates all posts when they appear on a multiple-post page such as the main blog page. It has the same effect as putting  <!--more--> after the first paragraph of every post. All formatting and HTML tags are preserved in the abbreviated post.

If the post already has a <!--more--> in it, then this plugin does nothing to it and the existing <!--more--> will behave as usual.

If you want to disable the plugin for any specific post, then include the codeword <!--nevermore--> in the post. This won't show up in the post, but it will prevent the post from being abbreviated by Evermore. 

DEVELOPMENT NOTES

All globals begin with "tguy_em_" (for Thunderguy Evermore)
Tested with PHP 4.3.8, WordPress 1.5.

// Add the "more" link immediately after reading the post from the database

/*	Add a "more" comment between the first and second paragraphs, unless
	there is already a "<!--more-->" (we don't add an extra one) or
	a "<!--nevermore-->" (user has disabled evermore for this post).
*/
	// Only continue if content has no "more" and no "nevermore"
	if ((false === strpos($post_content, '<!--more-->'))
	&&  (false === strpos($post_content, '<!--nevermore-->'))) {
		// Get the first paragraph including all surrounding whitespace.
		// First paragraph is the first closing block tag or the first
		// double newline, whichever comes first.
		// Important to add 2 newlines after the more, to avoid WP adding
		// a <br> after the more which leaves a spurious blank line.

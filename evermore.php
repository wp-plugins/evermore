Plugin Name: Evermore
Plugin URI: http://www.thunderguy.com/semicolon/wordpress/evermore-wordpress-plugin/
Description: Abbreviate all posts when viewed on multiple post pages. This makes all posts behave as if there is a "&lt;!--more--&gt;" after the first paragraph.
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Bennett McElwee
Author URI: http://www.thunderguy.com/semicolon/

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Copy this file into the plugins directory in your WordPress installation (wp-content/plugins).
2. Log in to WordPress administration. Go to the Plugins page and Activate this plugin.

Evermore automatically abbreviates all posts when they appear on a multiple-post page such as the main blog page. It has the same effect as putting  <!--more--> after the first paragraph of every post. All formatting and HTML tags are preserved in the abbreviated post.

If the post already has a <!--more--> in it, then this plugin does nothing to it and the existing <!--more--> will behave as usual.

If you want to disable the plugin for any specific post, then include the codeword <!--nevermore--> in the post. This won't show up in the post, but it will prevent the post from being abbreviated by Evermore. 

Tested with PHP 4.3.8, WordPress 1.5 and 2.0.
